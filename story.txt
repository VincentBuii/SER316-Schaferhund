The group decided to all pile into a BMW to spend some time at the beirgarten.
They were all eating Bratwursts that they had gotten from the Ratskeller.
After that the group started driving and ended up on the hauptstrasse.
While driving along, they were passed up by a Porsche blaring RammsteinMusik.
The loud music reminded them that the group supervisor had requested a ride from the Flughafen after flying in on a plane due from Berlin
Then, they decided to drive there while having some klimaanlage in the car due to the weather.
Once they do to the Flughafen, they parked their BMW behind an Audi as they waited for their supervisor.
While biding the time, thankfully someone remembered they had a bunch of gebaeck from the local baeckerei.
All of the sudden, the boss shows up wearing lederhosen.
They let him into the car and checked the schloss to make sure they were secure before driving off.
They dropped off their supervisor and headed to Berlin in search for a fun ratskeller.
While driving around in Berlin, they saw Professor Mehlhase walking on the sidewalk.
Shortly after the spotting, Professor Mehlase tripped over a hund and knocked over a bratwurst stand that was playing RammsteinMusik, the bratwurst vender was very upset.
The group's trip continued on to Raesfeld to visit castles.
After visiting castles, the group travelled up the hauptstrasse to catch up with Dr. Mehlhase.
